### Ethereum Middle client Concept, Modular Ethereum With Extensions; Offloading specialized, semi-critical logics from the Execution Layer client.

A standard interface for adding custom logics/extensions to Ethereum nodes with no concensus layer change, no hard fork, no L2!


it's a protocol-adjacent layer introducing a new type of ethereum clients with a new set of API endponts along side a custom transaction type with a unified p2p sub-pool that interacts directly with ethereum main public mempool each node on this network of new clients can have itsown set of Extensions.
I define Extensions as protocol-aware customizable components , that can be used to perform complex computations and validations that would be costly for the EVM and on the other hand not reasonable to do a hardfork for, an example of such computations could be ERC-4337 Bundlers.

# How Does It Work?
in a ZKP manner, Middle-Nodes act as verifiers and Extensios are provers, middle nodes maintain a routing tables of their neighbours and their respective Extensions, middle nodes regardless of the extension they have, can maintain their mempool to have all types of  operaions(a special txn). 
### Core Concepts : 
 #### * Middle-Client: new type of Ethereum node that sits between standard Execution clients and end-users
  * Maintains two mempools:
     1. Operation Mempool: unprocessed Operations
     2. PostOp Mempool: processed and validated Operations
  * Acts as a verifier of Extension outputs
  * Manages routing tables of peer Middle-Clients and their supported Extensions
  * Can enforce stake, fee, and reputation policies to prevent spam and maintain trust
  * Optionally participates in staking and slashing mechanisms to secure Operations economically
    
 #### * Extensions: a protocol-aware, customizable module that performs specialized computation/validation outside the EVM
  * Each Extension has a unique ExtensionID
  * Operates as a prover that processes Operations and generates validity proofs or post-processed outputs
  * Can be independently developed and deployed by any party
  * May require Middle-Clients to stake collateral, enabling slashing if the Extension produces invalid results
  * Makes Ethereum more modular, allowing new transaction types and processing logic without modifying consensus
  * Examples of Extension functionality: ERC-4337 bundler logic , Specialized compliance checks , Advanced signature schemes , ZKP circuit execution
  * could be written in any programming language as long as they're compilable and interpretable by WebAssembly Runtime
  * Extensions execute in private as opposed to EVM smart contract where execute everything in public.
  * Extensions do not change the blockchain state directly like smart contracts do, though they can call contracts and indirectly be responsible for a state change.
  * Extensions MUST return a proof with every call.
  * we require each node to generate a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) that it correctly executed the Extension.
  * (not sure) each Extension has a Network-Wide state, maintained by middle nodes.
  


 
we introduce two new (semi)transaction types. in regard to ERC-4337 we're calling them Operaions. 
 ### Operation Struct:
    type Operation struct {
      ExtensionID	string
      To       Address
      Gas      uint
      Data     []byte
      Sig	     []byte
      BlockHash  []byte // block hash upon op submission to pool
    }
 ### PostOperation Struct:
    type PostOp struct {
     OperationHash  string        // hash(Operation)
     ExtensionID   string
     Proof              Proof 
     Data               []byte
 
     ProcessedBlockHash []byte //block hash at the time of processing
    }

Middle RPC Nodes receive operations from users, they perform simple verifcation and reputaions management then the Operation would be submitted to the public mempool, middle nodes that have respective Extension to proccess that operation will pick it up, the operation would be processed and the post-prossessed operation will be sumbitted to another mempool called post-mempool.


so as shown on the diagram below the middle nodes manage and maintain to public p2p mempools: Operation p2p Mempool and PostOp p2p mempool

 # CHALLENGES

## Canonicality and Re-org Safety :
Before creating an Operation, the user's wallet queries an Execution node to get the hash of a recent, finalized block, it then gets included into the Operation.
After the Extension finishes its computation, it fetches the current block hash from the mainnet and includes it in the PostOp.
When a Middle Node receives and verifies the PostOp, it MUST performs a critical freshness check:

 1. It compares the ProcessedBlockHash against its own view of the blockchain.

 2. It enforces a rule: (RULE No. 1) the PostOp is only valid if its ProcessedBlockHash is very recent (for example, within the last 5-10 blocks).


If a re-org happens and the referenced block is orphaned (no longer part of the canonical chain), the Operation becomes instantly invalid. Middle Nodes can simply discard it because the previos state no longer exists. This prevents Extensions from processing operations based on a stale or reverted chain state.

the ProcessedBlockHash and RULE 1 also provide a defense against replay attacks, a malicious actor cannot take a valid PostOp from a week ago and submit it today, because the old ProcessedBlockHash would cause it to be immediately rejected as stale. 

* middle nodes CAN define a configurable PROCESS_WINDOW variable, it's an interval of slots in which an Operation is deemded valid.
  

## Incentive Mechanisms (TBD) :
middle nodes run Extenstions, since the Extensions work as provers in this architecture, middle nodes need to be paid fairly.

users also want their Operations processed for a predictable fee.
 
the gas fee can be paid by the user directly or be sponsered by another entity, all we need is an ERC4337 incentive flow and users commitment to a fee, this brings up a need for a singleton entrypoint-like contract we call it consensus contract. we'll be utilizing this contract to distribute rewards and gas, stake/slash incentive system etc.

## Proof Formats and Trust Minimization : 
 the proof system must:

* Allow Extensions (Provers) to prove correct processing of an Operation.

* Enable Middle Nodes (Verifiers) to validate proofs deterministically.

* Avoid reliance on central trust.

* Be general enough to handle: ZK proofs (snarks/starks) and other cryptographic attestations (Merkle proofs, signatures).

* Allow efficient verification without heavy resource demands.

* Allow Middle nodes to send validity proof packets to other nodes and receives proof responses. (this is to maintain a vaild reputation system and prevent middle nodes from altering an extension functionality)

   #### standard Proof object: 
      type Proof struct {
      ProofType     string            // e.g., "Groth16"
      ExtensionID   string            // erc4337
      Inputs        map[string][]byte // Public inputs
      Output        []byte            // Post-processed result data (e.g., calldata)
      ProofData     []byte            // The proof itself (binary blob)
      Metadata      map[string]string // Optional metadata (versioning, etc.) MUST include "CircuitHash"
      }
    


* Verifiability of Extensions Work: (nodes cross-verifying one another’s proofs)

   a peer challenge-response protocol (distributed attestation) 

  ### validity proof packets :

 We’ll define two main packet types:
 
   #### ProofVerificationRequest
  
      type ProofVerificationRequest struct {
        RequestID     string        // Unique ID for deduplication
        SenderNodeID  string        // Node issuing the request
        OperationID   string        // Hash of the original Operation
        PostOp        PostOp        // Full PostOp struct incl. Proof
        Timestamp     int64         // Unix timestamp
        Metadata      map[string]string // Optional context
        RequestHash  []byte
      }

   #### ProofVerificationResponse
      type ProofVerificationResponse struct {
      RequestID     string        // Echoed from the request
      ResponderNodeID string      // Who verified
      Verdict       VerificationVerdict // Enum: VALID / INVALID / ERROR
      Signature     []byte        // Signature over {RequestID, Verdict}
      Diagnostics   map[string]string // Optional error details
      Timestamp     int64
      }

  middle nodes use this information in order to manage the Reputation System.
   #### ProofVerificationReceipt (no sure if this one is needed)


### Proof System Flow:

1. Middle Node (A) produces a PostOp with attached Proof.

2. Before submitting on-chain, (A) broadcasts a ProofVerificationRequest to neighbors.

3. Neighboring nodes (Middle Nodes B, C, D) with the relevant Extensions re-verify the Proof.

4. Each neighbor returns a ProofVerificationResponse

* This creates a decentralized consensus over proof validity.
* This is the basis of middle nodes reputation system.

Nodes SHOULD rate limit verification requests per peer.

  ### Validity Attack protection : 
   how can we guarantee that: 1. The Extension logic is exactly the same logic other nodes expect for that ExtensionID? 2. The output and proof are produced by an approved implementation, not a malicious or buggy variant?

   we'll be using ZK Circuit Commitment committing each ExtensionID to:
* One specific ZK circuit definition 
* One verifying key 

This ensures all proofs are generated only with that circuit. Every Middle Node can deterministically verify them and that there is no ambiguity about what code was executed.
 ##### these would be a registry contract and a registry mapping like below : 
    ExtensionID → {CircuitHash, VerifyingKeyHash, ProofType, VerifierMetadata}

Middle nodes MUST only accept Operations referencing a known ExtensionID
Middle nodes MUST Only accept proofs that declare the circuitHash and are verified against the verifying key hash
Middle Nodes MUST check : proof.Metadata["CircuitHash"] == registry[proof.ExtensionID].circuitHash (before verifying)

#### Extension Registry Flow : 
two parties involved : Extension dev and Registry Smart Contract

1. Developer Prepares the Extension, the extension should be compilable to an arithmetic circuit (R1CS/QAP)
2. serializeed the constraint system to a canonical blob.
      * what do i mean by canonical blob ?
        A byte-serialized representation of a build artifact that every Middle Node can hash to the same value. we use WASM
        we MIGHT define a VerifierBinary struct in our design :

            type VerifierBinary struct {
            BinaryFormat string // e.g., "wasm", "solidity", "elf"
            BinaryData []byte
            BinaryHash []byte
             }



3. Trusted Setup (if needed): run trusted setup to generate proving/verifying keys.

4. Hashing

       circuitHash = keccak256(r1cs_blob)
       verifyingKeyHash = keccak256(serialized_verifying_key)
   
6. Verifier Metadata curve info, SNARK flavor ..
7. ExtensionID: it should be a unique string 

8. calling the registerExtension function of Registry Contract
   
       function registerExtension(
       string calldata extensionId,
       bytes32 circuitHash,
       bytes32 verifyingKeyHash,
       string calldata proofType,
       bytes calldata verifierMetadata,
       ) external;
   
Registry Contract MUST store a mapping of ExtensionID to ExtensionMetadata 
               
      mapping(string => ExtensionMetadata)
      
Extension Metadata struct COULD be : 

       ExtensionMetadata {
       bytes32 circuitHash;
       bytes32 verifyingKeyHash;
       string proofType;
       bytes verifierMetadata;

     }

******* After this point *********

Any node or user can query the registry on-chain to get the canonical circuit commitment and verifying key commitment for any ExtensionID.

### Middle Node Adding an Extension (Middle Node Onboarding)
  Imagine you are operating a Middle Node and want to add a new Extension to your already working set of Extensions (Fig. 1)
 1. query the on-chain registry -> GET ExtensionMetadata(extensionID)
 2. obtain verifier Code (could be a smart contract address) & Verifying Key
 3. acquire the Extension code and compile it to .wasm
 4. Store Extension Locally
 5. Store Extension Metadata Locally :
 
        json {
        "ExtensionID": "erc4337-bundler-v1",
         "CircuitHash": "0xabc123...",
         "VerifyingKeyHash": "0xdef456...",
         "ProofType": "Groth16",
        "VerifierMetadata": {...},
        "VerifierPath": "/extensions/erc4337-bundler-v1/verifier", or address : "0x....",
        "VerifyingKeyPath": "/extensions/erc4337-bundler-v1/vk",
        "Extension Dir": "/extensions/..."
        }
    
  6. modify the MiddleNode config file to register your extension, or run the register command (TBD)

### Operation Execution Flow and proof of honest Extension : 

  When a node and one of its extensions need to perform a task, we follows this process:

   1.The node starts with a known initial state (e.g., a hash of the current Operation, Extension Network-Wide state). (State TBD)

   2.Execute Program: middle node runs the WASM Extension and calls some functions, which take the initial state and some inputs, and produces a new state.

   3.Generate Proof: The middle node uses the execution trace as a witness. It feeds the witness and the Proving Key (PK) into a ZKP library (like a SNARK or STARK prover) to generate a compact proof.

   
   *Extension MUST return a proof with every call 
   
   4. local verification of Extension proof
   
   5.Network Verification
   The middle node then broadcasts its claimed new state(PostOp) along with the ZKP to the network.
   Other nodes act as verifiers. They do not re-run the program. They simply run the highly efficient ZKP verification algorithm using the Verification Key (VK), the initial state, the new state, and the proof.
   *If the proof is valid, the network accepts the new state as legitimate. 
   *If a malicious node were to tamper with the Extension code or fake the result, it would be unable to produce a valid proof, and the network would reject its update
   



#### Runtime Verification Flow : what happens when your middle node receives a PostOP
 1. verify the proof by running ZKP verification algorithm
 2. if verified : sumbit to the PostOp pool
 3. re-run the Operation if : you recieved 2 or more PostOps of the same Operation to check the state trace.
(TBD)

  
(work in process) : 1. Define gossip strategies for distributing verification requests 2. build reputation scoring algorithms.

## Reputation System :
 reputation needs to be locally managed in two main scopes: 1. Extension Reputation 2. Middle-Node(peer) Reputation

### Data Models  
#### Extension Reputation
    type ExtensionReputation struct {
    //ValidProofRate
	// ValidProofCount / (ValidProofCount+InvalidProofCount) MUST BE > 0.8, too sensitive to initial failures, two defaults: prior_valid_proofs and prior_invalid_proofs
	// Score = (ValidProofCount + prior_valid_proofs) / (ValidProofCount + InvalidProofCount + prior_valid_proofs + prior_invalid_proofs)

	ValidProofCount   int // Number of valid proofs submitted
	InvalidProofCount int // Number of invalid proofs submitted

	// OperationAcceptanceRate
	//if OperationAcceptanceRate < 0.6, then the extension is considered unreliable and socket connection is closed
	OperationAcceptanceCount int // Number of Operations accepted by the extension
	OperationRejectionCount  int // Number of Operations rejected by the extension

	// latency is relative to the specific ExtensionID node decides this on local registration,
	// if latency > OperationExecutionLatency, then the extension is considered unreliable and therefore throttled.
	OperationExecutionLatency int // Time taken to process an Operation into PostOp

	Staked          bool
	StakeBalance    uint64 // Amount of stake held by the node or extension
	NegativeSlashes int    // Number of times the node or extension was penalized for malicious behavior

	LastActiveTimestamp time.Time // Last time the node or extension was active

	Blacklisted      bool
	BlacklistedUntil time.Time // If blacklisted, the time until which it is blacklisted

    }
    
#### Middle-Node Reputation
    type MiddleNodeReputation struct {
 	ValidProofCount   int // Number of valid proofs submitted to p2p mempool my the peer
	InvalidProofCount int // Number of invalid proofs submitted to p2p mempool my the peer

	// OperationAcceptanceRate
	//if OperationAcceptanceRate < 0.6, then the peer is considered unreliable and socket connection is closed
	OperationAcceptanceCount int // Number of Operations accepted by the peer
	OperationRejectionCount  int // Number of Operations rejected by the peer

	ProofVerificationLatency time.Duration // Time taken to verify a proof //middle node only
	AvailabilityScore        float64       // % uptime responding to requests // middle node only // > 0.8 okay, < 0.8 throttled, < 0.5 banned

	// DisputeOutcomeScore > 0.8 okay // DisputeOutcomeScore < 0.8 throttled , // DisputeOutcomeScore < 0.5 banned
	DisputeOutcomeScore float64 // % of times a node was challenged and proved correct vs incorrect

	staked          bool
	StakeBalance    uint64 // Amount of stake held by the node or extension
	NegativeSlashes int    // Number of times the node or extension was penalized for malicious behavior

	PeerEndorsements []string // List of peer endorsements or challenges

	LastActiveTimestamp time.Time // Last time the node or extension was active

	Blacklisted      bool
	BlacklistedUntil time.Time // If blacklisted, the time until which it is blacklisted
    }
### ReputationScore formula + Design on-chain dispute resolution -> TBD 


## Extension Registry Smart Contract :

## Final Bridge to L1; Consensus over Submission
  who gets to submit the final tx to the mainnet mempool?
  in each slot(12s) there would be only one submitter and only that one is eligible for compensation,
  there would be a singleton Consensus Contract this contract :
* keeps track of submitter in each slot(epoch) -> noodes run a deterministic leader election algorithm (like the XOR check), consensus contract manages the compensation of middle nodes
* Fee and Reward Distribution
* stake/slash management
* Proof Validation
     
   
  
## Specifications: 
  ### P2P stack: 
  we will utilize the ethereum execution client p2p stack, devp2p and Kademlia tables to manage our decentralized network of middle nodes.
  RLPx, DiscV5 and ENR are completely utilized.
   node MUST broadcast a Capability Advertisement Packet upon peer connection so they can advertise SupportedExtensions, SupportedProofTypes , MaxProofSize , FeeSchedule


NOTICE : 
reducing txn congestion on base layer in not the direct intent of this design but it can be utilized to also act as an L2 rollup 

Data Availability Proofs are optional.
